def monte_carlo(handranges, board='', dead='', hand_values=True):
    '''
    Takes a game situation and returns a bunch of useful info based
    on monte carlo rollout of the board.

    For example, I raise preflop heads-up, you call, flop comes AcTdKh
    `montecarlo([preflop_raise_range, preflop_call_range], board='AcTdKh')`
    Tells me the relative values of each hand in those ranges,
    plus each players' probability of winning (assuming they go
    all-in right now).

    Calls out to highly-optimized C++ process found in 'bin/monte_carlo'
    If the binary doesn't work on your architecture, you can clone
    https://github.com/cowpig/monte-carlo
    and compile it locally

    for now this can only evaluate NLHE.

    inputs -
    handranges: a list of HandRange objects, or handranges described
        by strings, e.g. "AcAh,AsAd..."
    board: a Hand objct or string describing the board e.g. "Ac3d4c"
    dead: a Hand object or string describing cards to be excluded from
        the montecarlo evals
    hand_values: bool. if True, record the winrates on a hand-by-hand
        basis. Note that this calculation is biased if the input ranges
        are not identical. e.g. the second-worst-possible hand on the
        river will have a 100% winrate if the range it is up against
        consists solely of the worst-possible hand.

    output - a dict that looks like this:
    {
        'input': {
            'ranges': <list of str>,
            'board': <str>,

            'total_proc_time': <float; total processing time in seconds>
            'stdev': <float; represents the error bounds of 'equity',

            # these can probably be ignored unless you're debugging

            'evaluations': <int; # of monte carlo simulations>,
            'players': <int; should be equal to len(ranges)>,
            'recordHandWins': <bool; should be equal to hand_values>,
            'board': <int; this is a cardmask and should be ignored>,
            'dead': <int; this is a cardmask and should be ignored>,
            'ties': <list of floats; number of ties for each range>,
